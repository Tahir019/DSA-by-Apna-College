#### Important term's
- Contagiously --- This means that all the items in the array are stored right next to each other in memory, without any gaps. It helps the computer quickly find any item by its index.

- Stack --- The Stack is a part of the computer's memory that is used for storing temporary variables, like when you create arrays inside functions. The memory is automatically cleared after the function ends.

- Heap --- The Heap is a different part of memory where larger and more permanent data is stored. Arrays in the heap are not cleared automatically, so you need to manually manage them
