## 1. Call Stack

The **call stack** is a special type of memory used to keep track of function calls. Every time a function is called:
- A new block (or "frame") is pushed onto the stack.
- This frame contains data such as parameters, local variables, and the return address.
- When a function finishes executing, its frame is popped from the stack.

Understanding the call stack is crucial because:
- It determines the order in which functions are executed.
- It helps track what happens when recursive functions are called.

### Easy Short Definition for Interview--
- The call stack is a special type of memory used to keeps track of function calls in a program. When a function is called, it is pushed onto the call stack. When the function finishes, it is popped off the stack.
  
### Key Concept:
- **Stack Overflow:** A stack overflow occurs when the call stack runs out of memory due to infinite recursion (a function calling itself without stopping) or too many function calls, causing the program to crash.

- **Call Stack:** Memory that tracks active function calls.
- **Recursion:** When a function calls itself.
- **Infinite Recursion:** Endless function calls without an exit condition.

## 2. What Happens in Memory? ### (When a Function is Called)

When a function is called, memory is divided into two main areas:
- **Stack Memory:** Stores local variables and function call information (like parameters and return addresses). Memory is automatically released when the function returns.
- **Heap Memory:** Allocates memory for dynamically created data (using new or malloc). The programmer must manually free this memory.
  
The **execution flow** involves pushing function calls onto the call stack and allocating memory for variables on the stack or heap.

### Fun Fact:
Memory is automatically reclaimed when functions return, freeing up space on the call stack.

## 3. Scope in C++

### Local Scope
Variables declared inside a function or block (`{}`) are **local** to that function or block. They cannot be accessed outside.

Example:
```cpp
void myFunction() {
    int x = 10;  // Local to this function
}
```

### Global Scope
Variables declared outside all functions are **global** and can be accessed by any part of the code.

Example:
```cpp
int globalVar = 5;  // Global variable
void myFunction() {
    globalVar = 10;  // Can modify globalVar
}
```

### Function Scope
Function scope refers to the visibility of variables declared inside a function, including in loops and conditionals, have **function scope** and cannot be accessed outside the function.

Example:
```cpp
void checkOddOrEven(int a) {
    if (a % 2 == 0) {
        int localVar = 1;  // Local to this if block
    }
}
```

---

## 4. Loops and Conditional Statements

- **Loops** (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) and **if-else statements** affect how the program runs, but variables declared within these blocks have **local scope**.

Example:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    int loopVar = i;  // Local to this loop
}
```

Variables like `loopVar` only exist inside the loop. When the loop ends, they are destroyed.

---

## 5. Function Overloading

**Function Overloading** is a feature in C++ where two or more functions can have the same name but different parameters types or number. The compiler decides which function to call based on the arguments provided.

Example:
```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

double add(double a, double b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

In the above example, `add()` is overloaded. The appropriate version is chosen based on the data types of the arguments.

### Unique Concept:
- **Compile-time Polymorphism:** Function overloading is an example of this, as the function to be called is determined at compile time.

# Updated Knowledge

## Lambda Expressions
These are small, **anonymous functions** (functions without a name) that you can write in place, usually for quick tasks. They became available in C++11 and are handy when you don't need to reuse a function multiple times.

### Example:
```cpp
auto sum = [](int a, int b) { return a + b; };
int result = sum(5, 10);  // Result is 15
```
- **Anonymous Function:** A function without a name that can be used quickly in the code.

---

## Inline Functions
For small functions, **modern compilers** can make them **inline**, meaning the function's code is inserted directly where it's called. This avoids the extra step of calling the function, making the program faster.

### Example:
```cpp
inline int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
```
- **Inline:** Directly placing the code of the function where it is called, avoiding overhead.

## Conclusion

Understanding functions, scopes, and memory is essential in mastering C++. Functions are the building blocks of reusable code, and advanced concepts like function overloading and call stack management make your code efficient.
